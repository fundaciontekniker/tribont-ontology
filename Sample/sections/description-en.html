<p>The <i>Sample</i> class represents the elements of the sample hierarchy model involved in the tribological experiments. A sample has always a specific body configuration (<i>Body</i> class), it is made of a specific core material (<i>hasCoreMaterial</i> object property) and can be characterised by a set of technical properties (<i>TechnicalProperty</i> class). Furthermore, a sample can have a coating (<i>Coating</i> class, <i>hasCoating</i> object property) made of a specific core material (<i>hasCoreMaterial</i> object property) and characterised by specific properties (<i>CoatingProperty</i> class) such as thickness (<i>CoatingThickness</i> class) or type (<i>CoatingType</i> class). Both the <i>CoatedSample</i> (i.e., representing the samples which include a coating) and <i>LubricationSample</i> classes (i.e., representing the samples used as lubricants) are a specialisation of the <i>Sample</i> class. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The <i>SampleBatch</i> class describes a grouping of samples which have been prepared at the same time following the same procedure and have similar characteristics. Each sample belonging to a sample batch inherits the entire representation of the <i>SampleBatch</i> class and can be further particularised.</p>

<p>The <i>SampleSystem</i> class represents the tribological system involved in the tribological experiments that includes two or more static (<i>hasStaticSample</i> object property) and moving (<i>hasMovingSample</i> object property) samples (<i>Sample</i> class)  that interact (<i>interactsWith</i> object property) with each other. In addition a sample system can include a lubricant (<i>hasLubricationSample</i> object property). Sample systems are characterised  by specific properties (<i>SystemProperty</i> class) such as the geometrical arrangement (<i>GeometricalArrangement</i> class) describing the geometrical combination of bodies belonging to the tribological system (e.g., ball on disc), the  type of contact surfaces (<i>ContactSurfaceType</i> class) or the number of contact surfaces (<i>NumberOfContactSurface</i> class). <i>LubricatedSampleSystem</i> class is a specialisation of the SampleSystem class representing the sample systems that include a lubricant. </p>

<p>Figure 1 includes an UML diagram representing the main classes and object properties linked to the <i>Sample</i> module.</p>
