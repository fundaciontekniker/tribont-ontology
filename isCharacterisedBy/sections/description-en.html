<span class="markdown">

<p>The goal of this ontology design pattern is to characterise a subject or group of subjects of interest (<i>SubjectOfInterest</i> class) by assigning qualifiable or quantifiable attributes or characteristics (<i>Property</i> class). Quantitative properties can be described either by a specific value (<i>value</i> data property) or a range of values (<i>minValue, masValue</i> data properties), and including the unit of measurement (<i>Unit</i> class and <i>hasUnit</i> object property). A property cannot exist without characterising at least a subject of interest.</p>
<p>As described a <i>SubjectOfInterest</i> class can describe either a subject of interest or a grouping of subjects of interest which have similar characteristics. If it represents an aggrupation, the subjects of interest belonging to the group inherits all the properties that characterise it and can be further particularised.</p>
<p>Figure 1 includes an UML diagram representing the main classes and object properties linked to the <i>isCharacterisedBy</i> ontology design pattern.</p>
