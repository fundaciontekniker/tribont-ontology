<p>This module includes the <i>Body</i> class that is used in both the <i>Equipment</i> (i.e., referring to the body configuration of the sample that can be hold by an equipment) and <i>Sample</i> (i.e., representing the body of a sample) modules. Furthermore, it includes the <i>TechnicalProperty</i> (i.e., representing qualifiable or quantifiable technical attributes, or characteristics that are used in <i>TribOnt</i>, and <i>Material</i> and <i>Sample</i>  modules), <i>SystemProperty</i> (i.e., representing  qualifiable or quantifiable  attributes, or characteristics of a sample system that are used in <i>Sample</i> and <i>Equipment</i> modules) and <i>OperationProperty</i> (i.e., representing  quantifiable operation attribute, or characteristic used in <i>TribOnt</i> and <i>Equipment</i>module) classes which are specialisations of the <i>Property</i> class. Each of these classes in turn includes a series of specialisations like for the <i>Unit</i> class. For example, the <i>OperationalProperty</i> class includes as specialisation, along with others, the <i>EnvironmentProperty</i> class which in turn includes the <i>Pressure</i>, <i>Humidity</i>, <i>Temperature</i>, etc. classes. In addition, it includes <i>Organisation </i>, <i>Document</i>, <i>Role</i> and <i>Standard</i> classes which are used in several modules.</p>
